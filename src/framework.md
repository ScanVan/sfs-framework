# Prupose

* Implementation of the full spherical framework
* implementation of the main backbone and subsequent elements

# Data Structures

* viewpoint (image and their viewpoint related data)
* transform (between image transformation data)
* matches (image couple matching data and links)
* structure (scene point related data and their link to viewpoints)
* io (input/output path and storage related data)
* parameter (pipeline parameters related data)

# Modules

* framework (entry point and main backbone)
* framework-viewpoint (viewpoint related data and functions)
* framework-transform (transformation related data and functions)
* framework-matches (image pair matches related data and functions)
* framework-structure (scene point related data and functions)
* framework-io (i/o related data and functions)
* framework-parameter (pipeline parameter related data and functions)
